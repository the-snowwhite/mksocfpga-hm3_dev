This is a new copy of the mksocfpga repo, for experimental development towards a more modular configuration hal run-time style. 

I have created this repo as a placeholder for futuristic development of the mksocfpga project.

Entitled Hostmot3

Current focus here is on getting partial (re)configuration to work.

The mksocfpga project is getting very near to handing off the final bits and pieces to Machinekit.

Right now All 3 HW boards are Machinekit functional.

There is very soon a Mksocfpga Omap Builder based Sd-Image for the Nano online.

The DE1-Soc board only needs to have the 3 Quartus output files replaced in the /boot folder to work.

The SoCKit board also needs replacement of the u-boot binary.
