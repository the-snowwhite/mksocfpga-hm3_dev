The mksocfpga project is getting very near to handing off the final bits and pieces to Machinekit.

Right now All 3 HW boards are Machinekit functional.

There is very soon a Mksocfpga Omap Builder based Sd-Image for the Nano online.

The DE1-Soc board only needs to have the 3 Quartus output files replaced in the /boot folder to work.

The SoCKit board also needs replacement of the u-boot binary.
